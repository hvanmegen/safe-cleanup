# Safe Cleanup

This Python script helps you delete a limited number of files and directories from a specified directory. It is designed to handle various conditions such as slow file deletions and errors during the deletion process.

It's originally created for (and especially useful on) very large and possibly slow filesystems such as CephFS.

## Features

- Specify the directory and the number of files/directories to delete.
- Optional verbose mode to display detailed output with a progress bar.
- Handles slow file deletions by waiting and doubling the wait time if necessary.
- Quits if a single file deletion takes more than 30 seconds.
- Gracefully handles KeyboardInterrupt (CTRL-C) to stop the process.
- Exits with an error message if the maximum number of errors is reached.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Python 'tqdm' module (used for the process bar handling)
- Python 'numerize' module for advanced number formatting (optional, will fallback to simple comma usage for numbers above 999 such as 1,000,000.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can check this by running `python --version` or `python3 --version`.
2. Install the `tqdm` module using pip:
```
pip install tqdm
```

3. Optionally, you can install the `numerize` module using pip:
```
pip install numerize
```

## Usage

Run the script from the command line with the following syntax:
```
python cleanup.py [-v] <directory> <number_of_items>
```
- `-v` or `--verbose`: (Optional) Enable verbose mode for detailed output.
- `<directory>`: The directory path from which you want to delete files and directories.
- `<number_of_items>`: The number of files and directories to delete.

Example:

```
python cleanup.py -v /path/to/directory 100000
```

This command will delete 100000 files/directories from `/path/to/directory` and display detailed output with a progress bar.
